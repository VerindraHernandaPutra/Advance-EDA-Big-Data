# Advanced LAAS - Big Data EDA

This repository contains various exercises and challenges designed to test your skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The exercises are part of the **Machine Learning and Big Data Community (MBC)** lab and consist of **4 levels**, where each level increases in difficulty and complexity. 

## Overview

In this repository, you will find multiple datasets with different characteristics. The exercises are intended to help you develop your skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis, leading to meaningful insights. Each level has a specific set of instructions and objectives, from basic visualization to more complex data manipulations.
