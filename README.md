# Advanced LAAS - Big Data EDA

This repository contains various exercises and challenges designed to test your skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The exercises are part of the **Machine Learning and Big Data Community (MBC)** lab and consist of **4 levels**, where each level increases in difficulty and complexity. 

## Overview

In this repository, you will find multiple datasets with different characteristics. The exercises are intended to help you develop your skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis, leading to meaningful insights. Each level has a specific set of instructions and objectives, from basic visualization to more complex data manipulations.

## **LEVEL 1 - Basic Visualizations**

In this level, you are required to create at least **3 different types of visualizations** for each dataset to explore and represent the data.

### **LEVEL 1 - EP (Energy Production Data)**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains the historical production data of IPG2211AN (Electric Energy).
- **Task**: Create a line plot to compare the monthly values of IPG221A2N between the years 2015, 2016, and 2017.

### **LEVEL 1 - DB (Diabetes Data)**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains glucose levels, blood pressure, and insulin data from individuals with and without diabetes.
- **Task**: Create a box plot to compare the distribution of glucose levels between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

## **LEVEL 2 - Deeper Analysis with Insights**

For this level, you are required to provide **3 insights** based on the visualizations you perform.

### **LEVEL 2 - A. Financial Risk Data**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains detailed financial profiles of individuals, with various attributes indicating their financial risk.
- **Task**: Perform an EDA and provide 3 insights based on the data.

### **LEVEL 2 - B. Delhivery Logistics Data**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains logistics and supply chain data from Delhivery, a logistics company.
- **Task**: Perform an EDA and provide 3 insights from the dataset.

## **LEVEL 3 - Complex Joins and Aggregations**

This level involves more challenging tasks, including combining multiple datasets using **joins** and providing insights.

### **LEVEL 3 - A. Taxi Data (Join)**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains information on taxi owners and their vehicles.
- **Task**: Perform a **join** operation between taxi owners and taxi vehicles datasets. Then analyze the data.

### **LEVEL 3 - B. Movies Data (Join)**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains information about movies, including actors, directors, and genres.
- **Task**: Perform a **join** between the various movie-related datasets and provide meaningful insights.

### **LEVEL 3 - C. F1 Racing Data (Join)**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains comprehensive information on F1 races, including drivers, race results, and lap times.
- **Task**: Join the various F1 datasets and perform analysis on Max Verstappen's performance in races.

## **LEVEL 4 - GIS and Big Data Integration**

This level focuses on integrating **GIS (Geographic Information System)** data with **Big Data** analytics.

### **LEVEL 4 - 1. Set up Dataset for Plotting on Map**

- **Dataset**: This dataset contains geographic data points that need to be mapped onto a geographical map.
- **Task**: Prepare the dataset to be visualized on a map.

### **LEVEL 4 - 2. Map Points Placement**

- **Dataset**: Using the prepared dataset, you will plot points on a map.
- **Task**: Place the dataset points onto a GIS map and visualize them.
